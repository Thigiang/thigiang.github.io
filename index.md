<div style="text-align: justify">  First I converted the data into pixel and performed data analysis to understand how the data have been created for better modeling choices. Then I extracted the important features using PCA 95%. I trained machine learning models to learning pattern of normal and abnormal chest X-ray from the train data. Lastly, I used the train model to classified the chest X-ray from the test set with 90% accuracy. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify">  I performed comprehensive data analysis to handle missing values, outliers, perform feature engineering and feature selection to understand the important features. I ensembled machine learning models to predict the rental cost in Brazil. My most optimal model had resolved the severe non-normality problem and achieved an accuracy of 91% with a mean square error of 0.041.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> I used openai.Completion to generate a response for a given question and streamlit session state to get text input, store the chat and display the chat history. I was able to create a simple chatbot that can take in the users questions, direct it to openai ChatGPT and send back responses that are generated through openai.</div>
