<div style="text-align: justify">  I perform comprehensive data analysis to handle missing values, outliers, perform feature engineering and feature selection to understand the important features for modling. I ensemple machine learning model to predict the rental cost in Brazil. My most optimal model had resolved the non-normality problem and achieve an accuracy of 91% with a mean square error of 0.041.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> First, I used openai.Completion to generate a response for a given input or question. Then I used streamlit session state to get text input, store the chat and display the chat history. I was able to create a simple chatbot that can take in the users questions, direct it to openai ChatGPT and send back responses that are generated through openai.</div>
